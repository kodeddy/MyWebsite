    <H1>MUSIC HOBBY</H1>
    <p>
        As I mentioned earlier, I play 3 instruments and I make beats in my free time. I started playing the keyboard
        when I was in third grade. I also started playing violin shortly after, because I loved the way it sounded.
        I learnt both instruments simultaneously, and I was able to play them well enough to join the school orchestra
        in seventh grade with my violin.
        <br><br>
        My transition to the saxophone was a bit different. My initial interest in it was not because I loved the way it
        sounded - don't get me wrong, I loved the way it sounded - but my initial interest was based on jealousy.
        Hilarious,right? My 'enlightenment' happened after a night practice with the school orchestra in eighth grade
        (boarding
        school), and the brass and woodwind players started playing just to vibe amongst themselves. I felt left out
        because I didn't know then, how to join them while using a violin. That's when I decided to learn how to play
        the saxophone.
        <br><br>
        I started playing the saxophone in Spring of eighth grade, and I loved it instantly. I was a quick learner, and
        had great people around me to help me learn.I was able to join the school marching band and orchestra by the end
        of
        eighth grade. I started out with an Alto Saxophone, and then progressed to a Soprano Saxophone in eleventh
        grade.
        <br><br>
        I kept on playing the saxophone even in College, but I didn't try out for any of the bands or ensembles due to
        my major and potential semester schedules. Instead, I had fun playing instruments with small groups of friends,
        and
        even joined a music club!

        I started making beats sometime in HighSchool, and I have been doing it ever since. I started out with FL
        Studio, and I have been using it ever since. I have made a lot of beats, and I have even made a few songs with
        friends.
        I have also made a few beats for friends. I have a lot of fun making beats, and I hope to keep on making them
        for
        a long time. I primarily use my laptop, an AKAI midi keyboard, and in rare cases, my saxophone (live recording)
        when making beats. I primarily make Hip-Hop and Pop beats. I also dabble a bit in Afro beats, as well as UK
        Drill beats. You can find some of my stuff <a

    <H1>CODING HOBBY</H1>
    <p>
        I started working with Web Design in twelve grade, and I have been doing it ever since. I started out with plain
        drag and drop for the designs, but then right after High School, I learnt HTML and CSS. I soon after got
        introduced
        to Bootstrap, and I currently can't see myself willingly coding a website from the ground up without using
        Bootstrap - well, except now. I have also learnt a bit of JavaScript, and I am currently learning React. Here is
        a
        <a href="https://github.com/kodeddy" target="_blank">link</a> to my GitHub account.
