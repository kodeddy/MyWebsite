    <H1>MUSIC HOBBY</H1>
    As I mentioned earlier, I play 3 instruments and I make beats in my free time. I started playing the keyboard when I
    was in third grade. I also started playing violin shortly after, because I loved the way it sounded.
    I learnt both instruments simultaneously, and I was able to play them well enough to join the school orchestra in
    seventh grade with my violin.

    My transition to the saxophone was a bit different. My initial interest in it was not because I loved the way it
    sounded - don't get me wrong, I loved the way it sounded - but my initial interest was based on jealousy. Hilarious,
    right? My 'enlightenment' happened after a night practice with the school orchestra in eighth grade (boarding
    school), and the brass and woodwind players started playing just to vibe amongst themselves. I felt left out because
    I didn't know then, how to join them while using a violin. That's when I decided to learn how to play the saxophone.
    <br>
    I started playing the saxophone in Spring of eighth grade, and I loved it instantly. I was a quick learner, and had
    great people around me to help me learn.I was able to join the school marching band and orchestra by the end of
    eighth grade. I started out with an Alto Saxophone, and then progressed to a Soprano Saxophone in eleventh grade.
    <br>
    I kept on playing the saxophone even in College, but I didn't try out for any of the bands or ensembles due to my
    major and potential semester schedules. Instead, I had fun playing instruments with small groups of friends, and
    even joined a music club!
    <br>
    I started making beats sometime in HighSchool, and I have been doing it ever since. I started out with FL Studio,
    and I have been using it ever since. I have made a lot of beats, and I have even made a few songs with friends. I
    have also made a few beats for friends. I have a lot of fun making beats, and I hope to keep on making them for a
    long time. I primarily use my laptop, an AKAI midi keyboard, and in rare cases, my saxophone (live recording) when
    making beats. I primarily make Hip-Hop and Pop beats. I also dabble a bit in Afro beats, as well as UK Drill beats.
